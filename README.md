# PulseLaserSystem
For now, this is the stage controller of the pulse laser system.

The goal of this project is to controll both the stage and the pulse laser.

# Controller part
To controll the XY stage, you can use the joystock-like object or the buttons.

# Pulse laser part
You can controll the frequency of the pulse laser.

# !Caution
Make sure the selected IO pin is **10**.
